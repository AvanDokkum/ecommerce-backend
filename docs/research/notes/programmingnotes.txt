Notes

H2 database:
application.properties file:
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
The JDBC URL/location of the database needs to be defined as property =
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:test

To show the SQl being generated behind the scenes use property =
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
and to format the SQL use property =
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

JPA Entity:
An entity represents a table in a relational database.

To create a table from a POJO, annotate it with = @Entity, this entity needs a unique identifier.
To create a unique identifier for an entity, annotate a field with = @Id annotation.

Every field of the entity class would be mapped as a column in the database table.
Every created object of the entity class would be mapped as a row in the database table.

To give a specific name to an entity/table use @Entity(name = "table_name")

Examples of generation types for generating unique Id's =
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO) //default, let JPA choose strategy automatically depending on the database provider.
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE,
    generator = "order_seq") //use a database sequence to generate primary key values
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "order_seq",
    sequenceName = "order_sequence", allocationSize = 1) //definition of the sequence generator
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE) //make use of a table to simulate a sequence
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY) //use an identity column in the database to generate primary keys.

Repositories:
CrudRepository is basic Crud operations like Create, Read, Update, Delete
JpaRepository is a more specific definition of CrudRepository which adds more JPA specific methods like Flash, Save and Flash, and Delete in Batch

Validations in Spring Boot:
@NotNull
@NotEmpty
@Size(min = x, max = y)
@Email
@Min(value) and @Max(value)
add message like @Email(message = "Email should be valid") for custom messages
Use validations in combination with @Valid annotation in the controller
